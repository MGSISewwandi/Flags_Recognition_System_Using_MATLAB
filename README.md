# Flags_Recognition_System_Using_MATLAB
This project is to recognize flags from different countries using image processing techniques.
Flag recognition of different countries is a difficult and troublesome task. 
In an attempt to simplify this, proposes a system for recognition of flags of the countries of the world from their digital images.

The proposed system  is based on the image processing and makes the process automatic and robust.
The proposed system start with reading any input image, then recognize to which country it belongs. 
The procedure of identifying the country name consist several stages such reading input image, image processing and feature extraction and matching. 

The system establishment done on MATLAB program which provide user friendly interface for huge image processing tools and functions.
